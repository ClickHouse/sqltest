# The spec is ambiguous about this:
# 
# "<quantified comparison predicate>": Without support for <table subquery>
# 
# However, you can only have a table query on the right side, so they must mean
# that the query must must not reference another table?

sql:
  - CREATE TABLE TN ( A INT )
  - SELECT A FROM TN WHERE A <quantified comparison predicate part 2>
override:
  table subquery: ( SELECT 1 )
